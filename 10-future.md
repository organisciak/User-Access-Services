"The American Library Association’s Center for the Future of Libraries provides a fellowship for an individual or group interested in exploring the future of libraries.
The fellowship offers a stipend of $10,000 to advance new ideas and perspectives for the future of libraries through the creation of a public product – report, white paper, video, resource, tool – that will help library professionals envision the future of library collections, partnerships, services, spaces, or technologies."

# Funding

- library funding is nearly always as part of a larger organization, competing with other agencies for funds
    - This is the reality... so how do we work with that reality to continue high quality services?

------

- internal needs assessment - offer services that are inclusive but useful to your particular community
- externally: show your value
    - data first, not implied value
    - think back to assessment: how can you measure your impact in the community?

-------

- connected to data: evolving and pivoting
- advocacy
- making your case: clear plan/mission, able leadership, articulate link from needs to outcomes, realistic goals

## SROI - social return on investment

Tips from Evans et al. 2015, adapted from Lingane and Olsen 2004

- include positive and negative impacts of metrics
- focus on direct impacts rather than indirect
- don't double count
- be careful monetizing impacts
- contextualize data
- state all assumptions, test assumptions
- track impact over time

# Anonymity, Privacy and Ethics

_What impacts does online anonymity have on library services and users?_

---------

- can be used to damage
    - spreading offensive or bigoted material
    - illegal activities
- can also have a positive effect
    - role in intellectual freedom
    - provides community for people that don't want to participate publicly

- negative uses may require discussion, or make information literacy more important
- positive uses may need to be protected against blanket censorship

-------------

III. Libraries should challenge censorship in the fulfillment of their responsibility to provide information and enlightenment.

IV. Libraries should cooperate with all persons and groups concerned with resisting abridgment of free expression and free access to ideas.

- 24% of online adults use messaging apps that automatically delete sent messages ([Pew, 2016](http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-media-update-2016/))

- Research Data Services
    - support, expertise
    - technical resources
- Institutional Repositories
    - 1st party hosting for scholarly research

## Better living through hardware

Drones, robots, 3d printing, connected toys, internet of things, haptics, makerspaces

>- _Generously: how can these be useful?_
>- _What counterpoints are there? What risks do they pose?_

------

>- cost of ephemeral fads
>- haptics can help in learning
>- overly structured toys limit learning through play 
>- demographics: tech may need to fill in as working/retired ratio shifts

## The Future

- _Why_ do libraries change?
    - Why space evolution? Why makerspaces? Why e-books?

--------

### Licklider - Libraries of the Future

- dwindling physical storage needs
- knowledge graphs: information needs to be structured to be convenient
    - the dream of Linked Open Data and relationship graphs
- interdisciplinary boundaries: there's value in computer sciences, social sciences, library sciences
- we need a 'relevance network'
    - anticipates branches of relevance, and information retrieval ranking (think PageRank!)

----

- imagined 'pro-cognitive' systems - systems that augment your thinking
    - natural language interactions
        - user-based rather than system-based questions, on a system! (sorta...)
- techno-optimism, but imagining the future around _needs_, not _haves_
