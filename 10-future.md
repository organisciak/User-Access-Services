## Better living through hardware

Drones, robots, 3d printing, connected toys, internet of things, haptics, makerspaces

>- _Generously: how can these be useful?_
>- _What counterpoints are there? What risks do they pose?_

------

>- cost of ephemeral fads
>- haptics can help in learning
>- overly structured toys limit learning through play 
>- demographics: tech may need to fill in as working/retired ratio shifts

## The Future

- _Why_ do libraries change?
    - Why space evolution? Why makerspaces? Why e-books?

--------

### Licklider - Libraries of the Future

- dwindling physical storage needs
- knowledge graphs: information needs to be structured to be convenient
    - the dream of Linked Open Data and relationship graphs
- interdisciplinary boundaries: there's value in computer sciences, social sciences, library sciences
- we need a 'relevance network'
    - anticipates branches of relevance, and information retrieval ranking (think PageRank!)

----

- imagined 'pro-cognitive' systems - systems that augment your thinking
    - natural language interactions
        - user-based rather than system-based questions, on a system! (sorta...)
- techno-optimism, but imagining the future around _needs_, not _haves_
