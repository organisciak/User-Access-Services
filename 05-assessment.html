<h1>Assessment</h1>
<p>Measuring service needs, impact and quality</p>
<ul>
<li>considers whether to <em>add</em>, <em>change</em>, or <em>drop</em> programs</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Why assessment? How?</em></p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<ul>
<li><p>aligns with goals: libraries <em>want</em> to provide great services</p></li>
<li><p>helps publicize a library's worth to its community, while considering how that value can be maximized</p></li>

<li><p>Value to <em>potential</em> stakeholders; e.g. IMLS wants to see that their money would be put to good use, and Congress wants to see that IMLS makes an impact</p></li>

<h2 id="types-of-assessment">Types of Assessment</h2>
<ul>
<li>Needs assessment</li>
<li>Impact assessment</li>

<p>Assessment has internal uses (determining if you have the correct services properly provided) and external uses (accountability to library stakeholders)</p>

<h2 id="impact-assessment-instruction">Impact assessment: instruction</h2>
<ul>
<li>Satisfaction: did learners like the setting? The instructor?
<ul>
<li>Surveys</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Learning: was the content learned? Can the learner recontextualize it or recall it when needed?</li>
<li>Behavior: can the learning be applied?</li>

<p><strong>OBE Example 2: Museums Are Fun for Everybody</strong></p>
<p>Program Purpose: The Museum provides a series of workshops about its programs for mothers and 2- to 5-year-olds from the Hills High School parenting program and Cabot Park neighborhood to increase visits by local families and to increase the museum comfort level of mothers who rarely or never visit the museum.</p>
<p>Intended Outcomes: Mothers from Cabot Park and Hills High will feel more comfortable bringing kids to the museum and these families will use the museum more.</p>
<p><em>Indicators:? Sources: ? Target: ?</em></p>
<p><em>via <a href="https://www.imls.gov/grants/outcome-based-evaluation/basics">IMLS</a></em></p>
</section>
<section class="slide level1">

<p>Indicators: (a) The number of participating mothers who report their comfort in bringing kids to the museum increased to at least 4 on a 5-point scale, and (b) the number of Cabot Park and Hills High visitors in Kids' Week 2002.</p>
<p>Data Sources: (a) Questionnaire and phone survey for all mothers who participate in a workshop and (b) random exit interviews of adults who visit the Museum with children during Kids' Week 2001, repeated in Kids' Week 2002</p>
<p>Target: (a) Participants' reported comfort level goes up 75% or more from workshop 1 to 6 weeks after workshop 3 and (b) visits by target families increase from less than 1% in Kids' Week 2001 to 10% in Kids' Week 2002.</p>
