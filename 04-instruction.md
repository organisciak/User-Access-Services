## Information Literacy instruction

- defining information literacy
- teaching information literacy
- active learning as a technique

-------

"Being able to effectively locate, evaluate, and apply information to meet a need is the foundation of lifelong learning" - Evans, p.71

------

>"Give a man some information, feed their information need for a session. Teach a man information literacy, feed their need for a lifetime (or, at least a few years)" - Old Librarian Proverb

## Information literacy

to "be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information." - ALA 1989

_Transliteracy_: "ability to read, write, and interact across a range of platforms, tools, and media"

- increasingly thought of as a mix of literacies

------

## Components of information literacy

- key skills
- subject-specific competencies
- advanced information handling
- learning to learn

(Secker and Coonan 2013, via Evans et al.)

-------

## Types of instruction

- formal instruction
    - e.g. tours and orientation; workshops on technology, searching skills, research skills
- informal
    - _remember that all interactions can be instructional!_ - it doesn't need to be designed as such

---------------------

### One-shot instruction: single session

_What are the downsides to one-shot instruction? What are the upsides?_

--------

- more realistic for scheduling
>- desire to cram as much information in <- less effective way of learning

-------

### course-integrated instruction

>- just-in-time librarianship
>- more effective learning
>- complicated logistics

-------

## Active Learning

Learning by participating in the process of learn - rather than sitting, listening, and memorizing

- "anything that involves students in doing things and thinking about the things they are doing" (Bonwell & Eison, 1991).

- "anything course-related that all students in a class session are called upon to do other than simply watching, listening and taking notes" (Felder & Brent (2009)

----------

### Approaches

>- think-pair-share: short partner discussions in classification
>- problem- or case-based research projects
>- case studies
>- collaborative note taking
>- statement correction
>- quizzes and assessment
>- give time to think
>- preview and review
>- teaching material to a peer

-------

### Benefits

>- in lectures, attention starts to wane after 10-20 minutes
>- students have time to contemplate what they know, and what questions are outstanding
>- instructor is more sensitive to where students are, necessary corrections
>- addresses personal learning styles, allows for personal connections to materials
