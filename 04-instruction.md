## Information Literacy instruction

- defining information literacy
- teaching information literacy
- active learning as a technique

-------

"Being able to effectively locate, evaluate, and apply information to meet a need is the foundation of lifelong learning" - Evans, p.71

>"Give a man some information, feed their information need for a session. Teach a man information literacy, feed their need for a lifetime (or, at least a few years)" - Old Librarian Proverb

## Information literacy

to "be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information." - ALA 1989

_Transliteracy_: "ability to read, write, and interact across a range of platforms, tools, and media"

- increasingly thought of as a mix of literacies

The Seven Pillars of Information Literacy.

_What's missing? How do these skills develop?_

1. The ability to recognize a need for information.
2. The ability to distinguish ways in which the information “gap” may be addressed.
3. The ability to construct strategies for locating information.
4. The ability to locate and access information.
5. The ability to compare and evaluate information obtained from different sources.
6. The ability to organize, apply, and communicate information to others in appropriate ways.
7.The ability to synthesize and build upon existing information, contributing to the creation of new knowledge.

## Types of instruction

- formal instruction
    - e.g. tours and orientation; workshops on technology, searching skills, research skills
- informal
    - _remember that all interactions can be instructional!_ - it doesn't need to be designed as such

---------------------

### One-shot instruction: single session

_What are the downsides to one-shot instruction? What are the upsides?_

--------

- more realistic for scheduling
>- desire to cram as much information in <- less effective way of learning

-------

### course-integrated instruction

>- just-in-time librarianship
>- more effective learning
>- complicated logistics

-------

## Active Learning

Learning by participating in the process of learn - rather than sitting, listening, and memorizing

- "anything that involves students in doing things and thinking about the things they are doing" (Bonwell & Eison, 1991).

- "anything course-related that all students in a class session are called upon to do other than simply watching, listening and taking notes" (Felder & Brent (2009)

----------

### Approaches

>- think-pair-share: short partner discussions in class
>- problem- or case-based research projects
>- case studies
>- collaborative note taking
>- statement correction
>- quizzes and assessment
>- give time to think
>- preview and review
>- teaching material to a peer

-------

### Benefits

>- in lectures, attention starts to wane after 10-20 minutes
>- instructor is more sensitive to where students are, necessary corrections
>- addresses personal learning styles, allows for personal connections to materials

## Planning Process

via Grassian and Kaplowitz (2009), ELIS

- recognize the need
- describe and analyze the situation
    - perform a needs assessment
- developing goals and learning outcomes
    - write from the learner's perspective
- develop materials
- deliver
- assess and revise
    - Do they like it? Do they get it? Can they do it? Does it matter?
