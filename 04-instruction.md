## Information Literacy instruction

- defining information literacy
- teaching information literacy
- active learning as a technique

## Information literacy

to "be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information." - ALA 1989

_Transliteracy_: "ability to read, write, and interact across a range of platforms, tools, and media"

- increasingly thought of as a mix of literacies

**The Seven Pillars of Information Literacy**

_[SCONUL - Society of College, National and University Libraries (UK, updated 2011)](https://www.sconul.ac.uk/sites/default/files/documents/coremodel.pdf)_

The ability to:

>- recognize a need for information.
>- distinguish ways in which the information “gap” may be addressed.
>- construct strategies for locating information.
>- locate and access information.

The ability to:

>- compare and evaluate information obtained from different sources.
>- organize, apply, and communicate information to others in appropriate ways.
>- synthesize and build upon existing information, contributing to the creation of new knowledge.

- recognize, strategize, locate, compare, organize, synthesize

## Types of instruction

- formal instruction
    - e.g. tours and orientation; workshops on technology, searching skills, research skills
- informal
    - _remember that all interactions can be instructional!_ - it doesn't need to be designed as such

---------------------

### One-shot instruction: single session

_What are the downsides to one-shot instruction? What are the upsides?_


>- more realistic for scheduling
>- desire to cram as much information in <- less effective way of learning

-------

### course-integrated instruction

>- just-in-time librarianship
>- more effective learning
>- complicated logistics

-------

## Active Learning

Learning by participating in the process of learning - rather than sitting, listening, and memorizing

- "anything that involves students in doing things and thinking about the things they are doing" (Bonwell & Eison, 1991).

- "anything course-related that all students in a class session are called upon to do other than simply watching, listening and taking notes" (Felder & Brent (2009)

### Benefits and Approaches

via [Cornell Center for Teaching Innovation](https://www.cte.cornell.edu/teaching-ideas/engaging-students/active-learning.html), [Stanford Teaching Commons](https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/resources/teaching-resources/teaching-strategies), [Harvard Bok Center for Teaching and Learning](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/active-learning)

----------

### Approaches

>- think-pair-share: short partner discussions in class
>- problem- or case-based research projects
>- case studies
>- collaborative note taking: take notes and compare
>- statement correction
>- quizzes and assessment
>- give time to think
>- preview and review
>- teaching material to a peer
>- minute-paper

-------

### Benefits

>- in lectures, attention starts to wane after 10-20 minutes
>- instructor is more sensitive to where students are, necessary corrections
>- addresses personal learning styles, allows for personal connections to materials

## Planning Process

via Grassian and Kaplowitz (2009), ELIS

- recognize the need
- describe and analyze the situation
    - perform a needs assessment
- developing goals and learning outcomes
    - write from the learner's perspective
- develop materials
- deliver
- assess and revise
    - Do they like it? Do they get it? Can they do it? Does it matter?
