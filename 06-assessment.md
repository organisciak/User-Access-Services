# Services for Blind and Physically-Handicapped Users

------

### History

- late 19th c - Large libraries start collecting embossed books
  - expensive, unstandardized, local
- 1904 - Free Matter - mailing relevant materials for blind users is free
- 1917 - Revised Braille - US standard
- 1930s - Act to Provide Books for the Blind - establishing national library service
  - raised character books and audio books (talking books)

------

- 1940s - appropriations to buy and distributed record players to loan to eligible readers
- 1960s - now formats - slowing records, using tape
  - tape also slowed down, so 'talking books' played 6hrs rather than 1.5hrs
- 1999 - Web-Braille: online access to Braille (for download and embossing; now knows as Braille and Audio Reading Download)
- 2000s - [ANSI/NISO Z39.86](http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/14650/Z39_86_2005r2012.pdf) - Standard for the Digital Talking Book

------

### Copyright

- braille doesn't compete with publisher profits, but talking books might!
- _Solutions?_

------

> - copyright permission and statements
> - strict controls: LOC-produced talking books were centralized at libraries, with limited materials
> - DRM for digital talking books

------

1996:

> It is not an infringement of copyright for an authorized entity to reproduce or to distribute copies or phonorecords of a previously published, nondramatic literary work if such copies or phonorecords are reproduced or distributed in specialized formats exclusively for use by blind or other persons with disabilities.

------

## Materials for the Blind

- Braille: embossed dots
- Sight-saving Type: large-print (>13pt)
- Talking books
- descriptive video
- talking books: created by the government

# Assessment

Measuring service needs, impact and quality

- considers whether to _add_, _change_, or _drop_ programs

_Why assessment? How?_

---------

- aligns with goals: libraries _want_ to provide great services

- helps publicize a library's worth to its community, while considering how that value can be maximized

- Communication tool:  "Without data, it’s been said, 'you’re just another guy with an opinion.'" - [Outcome Based Evaluations](https://www.imls.gov/grants/outcome-based-evaluations), IMLS

- Value to _potential_ stakeholders; e.g. IMLS wants to see that their money would be put to good use, and Congress wants to see that IMLS makes an impact

--------

## Types of Assessment

- Needs assessment
- Impact assessment

Assessment has internal uses (determining if you have the correct services properly provided) and external uses (accountability to library stakeholders)

-----

## Impact assessment: instruction

- Satisfaction: did learners like the setting? The instructor?
    - Surveys
- Learning: was the content learned? Can the learner re-contextualize it or recall it when needed?
- Behavior: can the learning be applied?

------

## Tools

- Surveys
- Interviews
- Focus groups
- observation
- Citation analysis
- Transaction log analysis
- Logs, Diaries, and journals

----

## Outcome-based Evaluation

- Drawing a line from _inputs_ to _outputs_, contextualized by goals, users, stakeholders

- _Outcomes_ tied to indicators, sources, and targets

- Example OBE worksheet: [Evaluation Framework, New York State Library](http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/libdev/obe/basic/evl_frm.pdf)

------

## Outcomes

- Outcomes are measureable, direct, and clear
- They seek to measure *change* - in behaviour, skills, knowledge, attitudes

----

__OBE Evaluation Example 1: Columbia County Read Together Program__

Program Purpose: The Columbia County Public Library, Regional High School, Head Start, and Literacy Volunteers cooperate to provide story hours, literacy information, materials, and other resources to increase the time parents and other caretakers spend reading to children.

Intended Outcomes: Adults will read to children more often.

_Indicators:?
Sources: ?
Target: ?_

_via [IMLS](https://www.imls.gov/grants/outcome-based-evaluation/basics)_

------

Indicators: Number and percent of parents or other caretakers who read to children 5 times/week or more.

Data Source(s): Participant interviews.

Target for Change: At the end of year one, 75% of participating parents and other caretakers will read to children in their care 5 times per week or more.

------

__OBE Example 2: Museums Are Fun for Everybody__

Program Purpose: The Museum provides a series of workshops about its programs for mothers and 2- to 5-year-olds from the Hills High School parenting program and Cabot Park neighborhood to increase visits by local families and to increase the museum comfort level of mothers who rarely or never visit the museum.

Intended Outcomes: Mothers from Cabot Park and Hills High will feel more comfortable bringing kids to the museum and these families will use the museum more.

_Indicators:?
Sources: ?
Target: ?_

_via [IMLS](https://www.imls.gov/grants/outcome-based-evaluation/basics)_

----------

Indicators: (a) The number of participating mothers who report their comfort in bringing kids to the museum increased to at least 4 on a 5-point scale, and (b) the number of Cabot Park and Hills High visitors in Kids' Week 2002.

Data Sources: (a) Questionnaire and phone survey for all mothers who participate in a workshop and (b) random exit interviews of adults who visit the Museum with children during Kids' Week 2001, repeated in Kids' Week 2002

Target: (a) Participants' reported comfort level goes up 75% or more from workshop 1 to 6 weeks after workshop 3 and (b) visits by target families increase from less than 1% in Kids' Week 2001 to 10% in Kids' Week 2002.

---------

- Formative evaluation: assessment during the program
- Summative evaluation: assessment after the program completes

## Assessment in different library types

- Academic libraries
    - e.g. information literacy, learning support, technical skills
- Public libraries
    - e.g. basic literacy, consumer information, materials access, local history
- School libraries
    - e.g. problem-solving, digital skills, test prep
- Special libraries
    - return on investment, cost-benefit analysis

(Evans et. al 2015)

## Summary

- what and why: assessment
- tools
- formative vs summative evaluation
- outcome-based evaluation
