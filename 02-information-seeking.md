## Introductions post

--------

# Information behavior

>- "the totality of human behavior in relation to sources and channels of information, including both active and passive information-seeking and information use" - Wilson 1999

-------

- Today's class is likely the most theoretical in this quarter
  - Consider these models throughout the course

----

How do you seek information?

<div class="notes">
Examples of your information needs
</div>

-----

- Sense-Making - Dervin
- Anomalous States of Knowledge - Belkin
- Wilson's General Models
- Ellis' Model of Information Behavior
- Berry-Picking - Bates
- Communities of Practice - Davies
- Information Search Process - Kuhlthau

--------------

## Ellis model

_Starting - Chaining - Browsing - Differentiating - Monitoring - Extracting - Verifying - Ending_

>- _starting_: beginning activities, e.g. asking some knowledgeable colleague
>- _chaining_: following footnotes and citations or
‘forward’ chaining through citation indexes
>- _browsing_: semi-directed or semi-structured searching
>- _differentiating_: using differences in information sources as a way of filtering for useful information

-------

## Ellis model

_Starting - Chaining - Browsing - Differentiating - Monitoring - Extracting - Verifying - Ending_

>- _monitoring_: keeping up-to-date
>- _extracting_: selectively identifying relevant material
>- _verifying_: checking information accuracy
>- _ending_: 'tying up loose ends'

-------

## Chaining

- [Forward chaining on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=wilson+information+behavior)

--------

## Bates (1989) - Berry-picking

Bates lists six more strategies for information-seeking:

- footnote chasing (Ellis' "backward chaining")
- Citation search (Ellis's "forward chaining")
- journal run
- area scanning (what's in the library next to the book you want?)
- subject searches in bibliographies and abstracting services
- author searching

-------

![Wilson's General Model (1996, via Wilson 1999)](images/wilson96.png){class="plain"}

-------

In small groups:

- What types of passive search or ongoing search do you perform? In what way?
- What are we still missing from here?

-------

## Kuhlthau's Information Search Process (ISP)

- alternate conceptual framework to Ellis, more experiential
- focus on active search
- considers thoughts, feelings, and actions

-------

- _Initiation_ - person realizes a lack of knowledge or understanding
- _Selection_ - a general area or problem is identified
- _Exploration_ - a survey of material, which can be intimidating or incompatible
- _Formulation_ - focusing your search
- _Collection_ - gathering relevant information
- _Presentation_ - putting the learning to use

-------

**Feelings**

- _Initiation_ - uncertainty
- _Selection_ - optimism
- _Exploration_ - confusion, frustration, doubt
- _Formulation_ - clarity
- _Collection_ - sense of direction/confidence
- _Presentation_ - relief (then satisfaction or dissatisfaction as you start to use the information)

-------

In small groups:

- Do you agree with this process? These emotions?
- Have you recently experienced confusion or frustration during the exploration step?
- Is this useful? How might we apply this framework?

-------

## Dervin - Sense-Making

> "information-seeking and information-using occur when individuals find themselves unable to progress through a particular situation without forming some kind of new "sense" about something" (Dervin 86)

------------

## Dervin - Sense-Making

- Associated with shift from information _sources_ to _users_
- considers _cognitive gap_
- used in reference interview techniques (describing situation-gaps-uses)
- focus on verbs rather than nouns, emphasizing the process
- Information as a product of human observation, colored by situation and experience

-------

## situation-gaps-uses models

- situation refers to events that contextualize the lack of sense - or gap
- use is the purpose of the answer

'sense-making' is intended to rebut 'information-seeking'

-------

## Sense-unmaking

 If information is a product of human situation and experience, it is important to be able to deconstruct it and reconstruct it in new contexts. Power plays into sense-making, and recognizing it provides a way to adapt to that

-------

## Belkin (1980) - Anomalous Ways of Knowing

- anomaly between the person's knowledge and their ability to achieve some goals
- explicit about _cognitive viewpoint_: "processing of information, whether perceptual or symbolic, is mediated by a system"
- Anomalous state exists between different mediated states of knowledge

-------

![Belkin 1982](images/belkin-ask.png){class='plain'}

---------------

- Cognitive dimensions: Belkin (ASK), Dervin (Sense-Making)
- Emotional dimensions: Kuhlthau
- Information seeking process: Bates (Berry-picking)
- User and information context: Wilson, Belkin, Dervin

---------------

## Why does this matter?

>- assist in reference interview
>- positioning user, context, and emotional into instruction
>- expanding thinking about possible approaches (e.g. chaining, monitoring, passive search)
