### Course Overview

> "The library is a distinctly social phenomenon and as such is susceptible to all the influences that react upon our social structure." - Jesse Shera, 1933

----

This course is about libraries as service providers, and the relationships of those services to users.

We're looking at _roles_ and _needs_

----

Easy enough...

.. but what happens as user needs shift?

# Users

"Librarians who flinch at the word _customer_ are operating out of an outmoded paradigm. This older paradigm portrays the library as a "public good" with as high a ranking on the 'goodness' scale as the national flag, parenthood, and apple pie. However... unless it adopts and masters the language and techniques of its competitors, it faces a future of declining support and significance.""

 - Darlene Weingand, _Customer service excellence : a concise guide for librarians_, 1997

-----

>- Do you agree? Disagree?
>- Even if _customer_ feels icky... what would the _customer service_ lens entail?

------

- Thinking beyond service _offerings_ - including _quality_ and _satisfaction_
- Assessment - surveys, interviews
- Understanding the user, listening and responding
- Setting expectations
- avoiding unhappy users
- emphasizing communication in librarianship > dealing with people is central!
