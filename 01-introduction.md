### Course Overview

> "The library is a distinctly social phenomenon and as such is susceptible to all the influences that react upon our social structure." - Jesse Shera, 1933

----

This course is about libraries as service providers, and the relationships of those services to users.

We're looking at _roles_ and _needs_

----

Easy enough...

-----

.. but what happens as user needs shift?

Think of _User and Access Services_ as the first part of a two-year class.

We're establishing the foundation to build on through your MLIS.

# Introduction

----

### Who does the library serve?

>- Patron?
>- Client?
>- Customer?
>- User?
>- Guest

----

### Types of Needs

>- _Normative_ needs - those based on expert opinion
>- _Felt_ needs - community reactions to a problem or issue
>- _Expressed_ needs - actionable beliefs - what users *do* rather than *say*
>- _Comparative_ needs - those that noted relative to similar institutions and communities

----

_Normative, felt, expressed, or comparative?_

- Noting a dearth of space for patrons with laptops, a library moves less popular books off-site to add community space.
- Seeing the growth of makerspaces as a service in larger communities, a library budgets to add their own.
- A study finds that children participating in after-school reading programs score better in literacy testing.
- A library in a largely Chinese community hires more Mandarin-speaking librarians.

----

Not all needs can be addressed, and some conflict with each other.

Why?

>- budget issues
>- time, space
>- The values of experts and communities may misalign

----

_taking a step back to contextualize..._

----

### Four Basic Roles of Libraries

>1. _Acquiring_ materials deemed valuable or useful
>2. _Storing_ and _preserving_ those materials
>3. _Organizing_ materials for efficient access
>4. _Providing assistance_ to individuals in locating information

Evans (p.5)

>- _In this class, we look at access (3) and services (4)_

### Broad Library Types

>- Public
>- Academic

### ALA Code of Ethics

<http://www.ala.org/tools/ethics>

# Users

----

"Librarians who flinch at the word _customer_ are operating out of an outmoded paradigm. This older paradigm portrays the library as a "public good" with as high a ranking on the 'goodness' scale as the national flag, parenthood, and apple pie. However... unless it adopts and masters the language and techniques of its competitors, it faces a future of declining support and significance.""

 - Darlene Weingand, _Customer service excellence : a concise guide for librarians_, 1997

-----

>- Do you agree? Disagree?
>- Even if _customer_ feels icky... what would the _customer service_ lens entail?

------

- Thinking beyond service _offerings_ - including _quality_ and _satisfaction_
- Assessment - surveys, interviews
- Understanding the user, listening and responding
- Setting expectations
- avoiding unhappy users
- emphasizing communication in librarianship > dealing with people is central!

Are libraries for books, or for people?

>- Librarians disagree
>- Patrons disagree

### Multiple Spaces, aka the _Death of Shushing_

Libraries, especially public libraries, are increasingly trying to design around multiple spaces and multiple uses.

----

What spaces do we usually see in a public library?

>- Quiet, loud
>- media spaces
>- children's reading spaces
>- toddler, baby, family activity areas
>- multimedia, gaming
>- computer labs
>- book club, meeting spaces
>- book stores
>- music areas
>- archives
>- display areas
