# Needs assessment

- assessment between three interests:
    - community needs and culture, in the context of
    - the organization's mission and goals, tempered by
    - possibilities (space, time, budget, people)

Lisa Kropp - [Know Your Neighborhood: A Community Needs Assessment Primer](http://www.slj.com/2014/06/public-libraries/know-your-neighborhood-a-community-needs-assessment-primer/#_)

- Who lives here?
- What cultures are represented?
- Are there different languages spoken?
- What agencies in my local area serve the same audience?
- What does my county do for the same audience I’m looking to serve? What about the state level?

-----

- Are there elected officials who would be interested to hear of the library’s work with families of young children?
- What barriers exist within our building to serving young families?
- Are there barriers in the community that inhibit our growth to serving this population?
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of my staff?

-----

## Who are our users?

- census data
- gate information
- user surveys

## Community Analysis

_[community analysis form from the Colorado State Library](https://www.lrs.org/public/ca_form.php)_

- An inventory of what your community looks like
- Won't make decisions for you; rather, it helps inform your decision-making

## Reference

----

__Reference transactions__ are information consultations in which library staff recommend, interpret, evaluate, and/or use information resources to help others to meet particular information needs. Reference transactions do not include formal instruction or exchanges that provide assistance with locations, schedules, equipment, supplies, or policy statements.

- Reference and User Services Association (RUSA)

-----

A __reference transaction__ is an information contact that involves the knowledge, use, recommendations, interpretation, or instruction in the use of one or more information sources by a member of the library staff.

- Association of Research Libraries (ARL)

-----

__Reference Work__ includes reference transactions and other activities that involve the creation, management, and assessment of information or research resources, tools, and services.

- _Creation and management of information resources_ includes the development and maintenance of materials that patrons can use independently, in-house or remotely, to satisfy their information needs.
- _Assessment activities_ include the measurement and evaluation of reference work, resources, and services.

- Reference and User Services Association (RUSA)

__What's notable here?__

--------

- 'information resources'
- 'Creation and management'
    - 'We need to adopt the concept of "reference authoring" in how we conceive of reference' - Lankes, Atlas of New Librarianship

------

## Types of Reference Services

- Reference
- Guidance
- Instruction

------------

## Reference

- Ready reference
- Bibliographical verification
- Interlibrary loan & Document delivery
- Information & Referral
- Research
- Fee-based & Information brokering

<div class="notes">
Fee-based services sometimes seen in special libraries.

</div>

--------

## Guidance

- Readers Advisory (began in 1923 in Chicago)
- [Bibliotherapy](http://www.ala.org/tools/atoz/bibliotherapy) (began in 1951 at U. of IL)
- Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI)  (1958)

How are these practiced today?

<div class="notes">
Bibliotherapy looks to address trauma through immersion in relevant stories. e.g. books about death for children

- SDI, though outdated as a term, is still relevant today. It was a concept that considered profiling of users, followed by gradual dissemination of new data relevant to those profiles. Think Twitter/FB feed algorithms, or Google's news recommendation.
- Used in the talking book library
</div>

-------

## Instruction

- One-on-one
- Group

--------

Lankes: What's an 'answer'?

- librarians and users disagree
- users want something synthesized, librarians think in terms of sources

"We need to give members what they perceive as answers, not what we do"

----

Sometimes the answer is not enough

- appropriate response may require working with the user on learning how to get to the answer

--------

## Question Types

>- __Directional__. Information about library services / space: "Where do I return my books?"
>- __Instruction__. Learning to learn.
>- __Ready Reference__. Simple factual questions: "What is the average weight of an Asian elephant?"
>- __Reference__. More involved
>- __Research__. Require several categories of tools, more comprehensive
>- __Reader Advisory__. Connecting users to materials
>- __Referral__. Connecting users to services

-------

## Reference interview

- Interaction designed to tease out the *real* questions
- Recalling our information behavior models: sometimes a user isn't sure what they don't know

------

Based on your own experiences, what do you think makes a good reference interview?

-----

>- Be approachable
>- ask user-based questions, not systems-based (Dervin)
>- ask open-ended questions (closed=yes/no, this/that), then focus
>- verify (paraphrasing and summarizing), ask follow-ups
>- avoid jargon
>- avoid negative closures

-------

## Negative closure

- abrupt ending
- disclaimer
- failure to reference
- ignoring clues for more help
- premature referral
- sends to google
- referring user elsewhere, far away
- convincing user to accept easier to find information
- warning against success
- unmonitored referral

(Conducting the Reference Interview, Nilsen and Radford)

------

Instead of asking a system
question... (Conducting the Reference Interview, Nilsen and Radford)

>- _System Question_: Have you looked in the catalog/ looked at the author field in the MARC record/ checked the shelves/checked the databases for your subject?
>- _User-centered question_: What have you done so far?

-------

>- Do you know the subject heading/ search terms? keywords?
>- What would you like the book/ article/ site to cover? / What would you like your map to show?

-------

>- Do you want a directory? / encyclopedia/ biographical dictionary?
>- How do you plan to use the information?

-------

>- Do you want books or articles?
>- What format would help you most?

-------

>- That particular book is out right now. Do you want us to put a hold on it?
>- Perhaps we have another book available that will cover the same topic. What specifically were you hoping that book would include?
