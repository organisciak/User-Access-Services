## Other web issues

- inaccessible text (e.g. in images)
- no alt text on images
- inaccessible or untested web design

-----

- complete a task using touch-to-text
- If you wear glasses, trying to use your phone or computer without them (at arm's length if near-sighted, close up if far-sighted). See if any accessibility settings make it easier to read the news.
- Try to watch a Youtube video muted, with automatic captioning. How effective are the captions? Try to find a movie scene where you're familiar with the dialogue.
- Put on mittens and try to read a magazine. Go to the table of contents, find an article that looks interesting, then flip to that page.
