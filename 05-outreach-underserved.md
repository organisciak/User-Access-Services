## Persons of Color and LGBT populations

_Idea time! How might we serve systematically underrepresented or discriminated populations?_

-------

From ODLOS ([1](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/outreachtounderservedpopulations/servicespeople), [2]()):

- provide collections and programs that reflect their experience
- promote library services through relevant channels and events
- [recruit](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/workforcedevelopment/recruitmentfordiversity) staff where all people see themselves represented (relevant: [resources for librarians facing discrimination](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/workplace/discrimination))

## Homeless and poor populations

What issues do the poor and homeless encounter?

>- card and access policies required fixed address
>- conflation between trouble patrons and homeless
>- ill-trained or uncomfortable staff
>- limited promotion at relevant community centers
>- limited library access, re: transportation or hours
>- lack of relevant programs

###History

- late 19th c - Large libraries start collecting embossed books
    - expensive, unstandardized, local
- 1904 - Free Matter - mailing relevant materials for blind users is free
- 1917 - Revised Braille - US standard
- 1930s - Act to Provide Books for the Blind - establishing national library service
    - raised character books and audio books (talking books)

---------

- 1940s - appropriations to buy and distributed record players to loan to eligible readers
- 1960s - now formats - slowing records, using tape
    - tape also slowed down, so 'talking books' played 6hrs rather than 1.5hrs
- 1999 - Web-Braille: online access to Braille (for download and embossing; now knows as Braille and Audio Reading Download)
- 2000s - [ANSI/NISO Z39.86](http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/14650/Z39_86_2005r2012.pdf) - Standard for the Digital Talking Book

-------

### Copyright

- braille doesn't compete with publisher profits, but talking books might!

- _Solutions?_

------

>- copyright permission and statements
>- strict controls: LOC-produced talking books were centralized at libraries, with limited materials
>- DRM for digital talking books

-----

1996:

> It is not an infringement of copyright for an authorized entity to reproduce or to distribute copies or phonorecords of a previously published, nondramatic literary work if such copies or phonorecords are reproduced or distributed in specialized formats exclusively for use by blind or other persons with disabilities.

--------
