Karl Popper - _paradox of intolerance_ (1945)

> Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.

------

_What challenges may limit the access to services for these users?_

- hostile environments
- exclusive collections
- programs that don't address user experiences

------

## Traditionally under-served populations


- poor, homeless, hungry
- immigrants, refugees, new Americans
- ethnically diverse people
- people of color
- older adults
- adult new and non-readers
- incarcerated and ex-offenders
- people with disabilities
- LGBT populations
- rural and geographically isolated communities

### Worksheet

Second column - brainstorm solutions for the various challenges

------

### Worksheet

Considering your solutions:

- What are potential hurdles for the solution?
- What's the feasibility of the solution?

-------

## Persons of Color and LGBT populations

_Idea time! How might we serve systematically underrepresented or discriminated populations?_

-------

From ODLOS ([1](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/outreachtounderservedpopulations/servicespeople), [2]()):

- provide collections and programs that reflect their experience
- promote library services through relevant channels and events
- [recruit](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/workforcedevelopment/recruitmentfordiversity) staff where all people see themselves represented (relevant: [resources for librarians facing discrimination](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/workplace/discrimination))

## Immigrant Populations

-------

## Serving Non-English Speakers

>- [ODLOS - Top10 'To-Dos' ](http://www.ala.org/aboutala/offices/olos/toolkits/servetheworld) (_Good list for it's directness - it's doable!_)

-------

## Homeless and poor populations

What issues do the poor and homeless encounter?

>- card and access policies required fixed address
>- conflation between trouble patrons and homeless
>- ill-trained or uncomfortable staff
>- limited promotion at relevant community centers
>- limited library access, re: transportation or hours
>- lack of relevant programs
