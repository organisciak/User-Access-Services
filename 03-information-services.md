# Last Week wrap up

------

## Library services

- Overview of technical services: acquisitions, cataloging, and collections management
- Copy cataloguing vs. original cataloguing
- Classification
- Subject access
- Authority control and linked open data
- Metadata standards

------

## Acquisitions

- Moving to subscriptions and consortial access

- Varies greatly by library types
  - special libraries: going deep in a narrow area
  - academic libraries: monographs, serials / journals, faculty requests

------

## Acquisitions

- bibliographer recommendations
- trade publications
- working with intermediary vendors (Baker and Taylor, YBP, Blackwell)
    - library specifies material needs, and vendor automatically buys and ships materials

- Acquisitions Librarian - de-professionalizing (Helfer and Heinrich 2010)

-----

## Cataloguing

- describing materials for collection access, after acquisition

- Guidelines:
   - Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR) - 1967, AACR2 1988
   - Resource Description and Access (RDA)

------

- original cataloguing: creating a record from scratch
- copy cataloguing: starting with information from elsewhere

--------

# Vocabulary

From ODLIS (Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science):

-_bibliographic record_
An entry representing a specific item in a library catalog or bibliographic database, containing all the data elements necessary for a full description, presented in a specific bibliographic format.

-----

- Metadata: data about data (information about something)
- ODLIS: "Structured information describing information resources/objects for a variety of purposes."

--------

- three parts to cataloguing record: description, subject access and classification, and authority control

--------

## Subject access and classification

- subject analysis: what are the materials about?
  - uses a controlled vocabulary, like Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)

- classification: assigning a call number in a classification scheme, like Library of Congress (LCC), Dewey Decimal (DDC), or Universal Decimal System (UDC)

------

## Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)

<http://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First>

LCSH and LCC in context: [LOC online catalog](https://catalog.loc.gov/)

----------

## Authority control

- disambiguating strings from entities: connecting metadata to a central 'authority'

>- grouping authors with name variants, pseudonyms
>- Multiple versions of a work (translations, international version)
>- disentangling name matches
>- ISBN numbers, OCLC numbers

## Metadata standards

- MARC
- [Dublin Core](http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/)
- METS (Metadata encoding and transmission standard)

----------

## FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records)

- Model for representing entities and relationships between works, as well as people
- RDA is the cataloguing standard based on this model

-----

- Where does FRBR over-simplify? Where might it be inadequate?

# Types of Libraries

- What is distinct about your type of library?
- Who does your library serve? What roles do librarians play?
- What types of libraries are similar?
- Can you think of examples of the library? How you been to one?
- How common is your library?
- Who funds the library type?
- What facts surprised you from the reading? What outstanding questions does the article not answer?
