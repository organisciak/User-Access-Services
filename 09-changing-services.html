<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>YA: 12 through 18 (though constant discussion as to when to expand that age range)</li>
<li>YA services
<ul>
<li>separate from Children since late 50s</li>
</ul></li>
<li>&quot;Young adult services emphasize how library service can augment various internal and external assets that promote positive youth development in the categories of support, empowerment, boundaries and expectations, constructive use of time, commitment to learning, positive values, social competence, and positive identity.&quot;</li>
<li>YA: Materials about identity, social lives beyond family, emotions</li>
<li>Few libraries have YA Librarian (only big ones)</li>
<li>else: &quot;youth services&quot;</li>
<li>Newfound autonomy paired with quickly changing trends makes YA Advisory Groups very common</li>
<li>YA: patrons tend to congregate in groups, which can cause tension is spaces designed for solitude</li>
</ul>
<p>Children: - birth to age 11 - information-seeking: can't write well or read, not versed in search logic. Visual materials, reader's advisory are helpful - spaces: fun designs, lower shelves, colorful, with toys - types of services: promoting literacy,</p>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>demographic is growing</li>
<li>60 or 65 and up</li>
<li>subgroups: young aged (60-74), the old-old (75-84), and the 'oldest old' (85)
<ul>
<li>LIS often clumps these into a single group, but there are internal advocates for changing that, noting the usefulness of the subgroups</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Needs:
<ul>
<li>loneliness, dealing with loss, death and dying, aging process, fear of crime</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Aging and quality of life is changing, and baby boomers will have different needs as a result</li>
<li>Materials: mass media (tv, magazines, news, radio); some reliance on professionals among old-old and oldest-old</li>
<li>Resistance to technology - this is changing, but there's still a lag, while tech is growing more complex</li>

<ul>
<li>pronounce: &quot;Latin-Ex&quot;</li>
<li>Demographics vary broadly: important to learn your own community</li>
<li>Labels: Latino/a refer to people from Latin America, 'Hispanic' seemingly excludes non-spanish speaking or over-emphasizes colonial Spanish roots</li>
<li>LIS focus on latinx services fairly recent (since 1970s). REFORMA started in 1973</li>
<li>foreign-language materials, signage, staff
<ul>
<li>Because of US demographics, spanish-speaking services have been most common</li>
</ul></li>
<li>School and higher-ed materials have followed from laws that added more language course requirements</li>
<li>In profession: based on just one year (2003), 3% of MLIS recipients are latinx

<li>REFORMA established to connect and support latinx librarians</li>

<aside class="notes">
<ul>
<li>In early 20th c, African-American leaders sought to establish black libraries after being deined service at other public libraries.
<ul>
<li>appealed to Carnegie for support, and Carnegie grants helped build many black specific libs</li>
<li>Jim Crow laws and segregation led to black libraries, ironically feeding into the need for education and professionalization for black librarians
<ul>
<li>Atlanta University, Howard</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Northern libraries were integrated, though discrimination was common and upward mobility for black librarian was tough.
<ul>
<li>Article profiles some of those early librarians</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Large disparities in % of population served between white and black patrons</li>
<li>ALA didn't have any exclusion policies for black Americans. After the annual meeting was in segregated Richmond (1936) ALA passed a full equality resolution (subsequently keeping the ALA conference out of the south for 2 decades)</li>
