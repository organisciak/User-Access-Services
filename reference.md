### Course Overview

> "The library is a distinctly social phenomenon and as such is susceptible to all the influences that react upon our social structure." - Jesse Shera, 1933

----

This course is about libraries as service providers, and the relationships of those services to users.

We're looking at _roles_ and _needs_

----

![](images/userneeds1.png){class="plain"}

Easy enough...

-----

.. but what happens as user needs shift?


![](images/userneeds2.png){class="plain"}

----

![](images/userneeds3.png){class="plain"}

----

Think of _User and Access Services_ as the first part of a two-year class.

We're establishing the foundation to build on through your MLIS.

---------

### Topics

>- Instruction
>- Information behavior
>- Information literacy
>- Outreach
>- Assessment, evaluation
>- Library as space
>- Serving different population groups
>- Changing environments and services

----

### Learning Outcomes

-----

### About you

Learn something about your partner and tell the rest of the class.

- What are your career goals? What's an interesting thing about yourself? Do you have pets? What do you do in your free time? What's your first language? Why University of Denver? Why LIS? What's your least favorite thing about school? Do you like or hate _Inception_?

# BREAK

Let's take a break.

_If you have a computer, now's a good time for the two optional surveys: one on your preference of target group for the marketing proposal, and one allowing you to volunteer for the earlier deadline for the Information Literacy Instruction assignment._

# Introduction

----

### Who does the library serve?

>- Patron?
>- Client?
>- Customer?
>- User?
>- Guest

----

### Types of Needs

>- _Normative_ needs - those based on expert opinion
>- _Felt_ needs - community reactions to a problem or issue
>- _Expressed_ needs - actionable beliefs - what users *do* rather than *say*
>- _Comparative_ needs - those that noted relative to similar institutions and communities

----

_Normative, felt, expressed, or comparative?_

- Noting a dearth of space for patrons with laptops, a library moves less popular books off-site to add community space.
- Seeing the growth of makerspaces as a service in larger communities, a library budgets to add their own.
- A study finds that children participating in after-school reading programs score better in literacy testing.
- A library in a largely Chinese community hires more Mandarin-speaking librarians.

----

Not all needs can be addressed, and some conflict with each other.

Why?

>- budget issues
>- time, space
>- The values of experts and communities may misalign

----

### Four Basic Roles of Libraries

>1. _Acquiring_ materials deemed valuable or useful
>2. _Storing_ and _preserving_ those materials
>3. _Organizing_ materials for efficient access
>4. _Providing assistance_ to individuals in locating information

Evans (p.5)

>- _In this class, we look at access (3) and services (4)_

----

_taking a step back to contextualize..._

### Broad Library Types

>- Public
>- Academic
>- Corporate / Private
>- School
>- Special

-----

### ALA Code of Ethics

<http://www.ala.org/tools/ethics>

------

# Users

----

"Librarians who flinch at the word _customer_ are operating out of an outmoded paradigm. This older paradigm portrays the library as a "public good" with as high a ranking on the 'goodness' scale as the national flag, parenthood, and apple pie. However... unless it adopts and masters the language and techniques of its competitors, it faces a future of declining support and significance.""

 - Darlene Weingand, _Customer service excellence : a concise guide for librarians_, 1997

-----

>- Do you agree? Disagree?
>- Even if _customer_ feels icky... what would the _customer service_ lens entail?

------

- Thinking beyond service _offerings_ - including _quality_ and _satisfaction_
- Assessment - surveys, interviews
- Understanding the user, listening and responding
- Setting expectations
- avoiding unhappy users
- emphasizing communication in librarianship > dealing with people is central!

Evans

# Next Week

-----

# Information behavior

>- "the totality of human behavior in relation to sources and channels of information, including both active and passive information-seeking and information use" - Wilson 1999

-------

- Today's class is likely the most theoretical in this quarter
  - Consider these models throughout the course

<div class="notes">
Examples of your information needs
</div>

-----

- Sense-Making - Dervin
- Anomalous States of Knowledge - Belkin
- Wilson's General Models
- Ellis' Model of Information Behavior
- Berry-Picking - Bates
- Communities of Practice - Davies
- Information Search Process - Kuhlthau

--------

![Wilson's General Model (1981, via Wilson 1999)](images/wilsonmodel.png){class="plain"}

-------

![Wilson's General Model (1996, via Wilson 1999)](images/wilson96.png){class="plain"}

-------

- What types of passive search or ongoing search do you perform? In what way?

-------

## Ellis model

_Starting - Chaining - Browsing - Differentiating - Monitoring - Extracting - Verifying - Ending_

>- _starting_: beginning activities, e.g. asking some knowledgeable colleague
>- _chaining_: following footnotes and citations or
‘forward’ chaining through citation indexes
>- _browsing_: semi-directed or semi-structured searching
>- _differentiating_: using differences in information sources as a way of filtering for useful information

-------

## Ellis model

_Starting - Chaining - Browsing - Differentiating - Monitoring - Extracting - Verifying - Ending_

>- _monitoring_: keeping up-to-date
>- _extracting_: selectively identifying relevant material
>- _verifying_: checking information accuracy
>- _ending_: 'tying up loose ends'

-------

![Ellis](images/ellis1.png){class="plain"}

-------

## Chaining

- [Forward chaining on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=wilson+information+behavior)

-------

## Kuhlthau's Information Search Process (ISP)

- alternate conceptual framework to Ellis, more experiential
- focus on active search
- considers thoughts, feelings, and actions

-------

- _Initiation_ - person realizes a lack of knowledge or understanding
- _Selection_ - a general area or problem is identified
- _Exploration_ - a survey of material, which can be intimidating or incompatible
- _Formulation_ - focusing your search
- _Collection_ - gathering relevant information
- _Presentation_ - putting the learning to use

-------

**Feelings**

- _Initiation_ - uncertainty
- _Selection_ - optimism
- _Exploration_ - confusion, frustration, doubt
- _Formulation_ - clarity
- _Collection_ - sense of direction/confidence
- _Presentation_ - relief (then satisfaction or dissatisfaction as you start to use the information)

-------

- Do you agree with this process? These emotions?
- Have you recently experienced confusion or frustration during the exploration step?
- Is this useful? How might we apply this framework?

-------

## Dervin - Sense-Making

> "information-seeking and information-using occur when individuals find themselves unable to progress through a particular situation without forming some kind of new "sense" about something" (Dervin 86)

------------

## Dervin - Sense-Making

- Associated with shift from information _sources_ to _users_
- considers _cognitive gap_
- used in reference interview techniques (describing situation-gaps-uses)
- focus on verbs rather than nouns, emphasizing the process
- Information as a product of human observation, colored by situation and experience

-------

## situation-gaps-uses models

- situation refers to events that contextualize the lack of sense - or gap
- use is the purpose of the answer

'sense-making' is intended to rebut 'information-seeking'

-------

## Sense-unmaking

 If information is a product of human situation and experience, it is important to be able to deconstruct it and reconstruct it in new contexts. Power plays into sense-making, and recognizing it provides a way to adapt to that

-------

## Belkin (1980) - Anomalous Ways of Knowing

- anomaly between the person's knowledge and their ability to achieve some goals
- explicit about _cognitive viewpoint_: "processing of information, whether perceptual or symbolic, is mediated by a system"
- Anomalous state exists between different mediated states of knowledge

-------

![Belkin 1982](images/belkin-ask.png){class='plain'}

-------

## Bates (1989) - Berry-picking

-------

![](images/berrypicking1.gif){class='plain'}

-------

![](images/berrypicking2.gif){class='plain'}

-------

![](images/berrypicking3.gif){class='plain'}

--------

Bates lists six more strategies for information-seeking:

- footnote chasing (Ellis' "backward chaining")
- Citation search (Ellis's "forward chaining")
- journal run
- area scanning (what's in the library next to the book you want?)
- subject searches in bibliographies and abstracting services
- author searching

---------------

- Cognitive dimensions: Belkin (ASK), Dervin (Sense-Making)
- Emotional dimensions: Kuhlthau
- Information seeking process: Bates (Berry-picking),
- User and information context: Wilson, Belkin, Dervin

------------

## Why does this matter?

>- assist in reference interview
>- positioning user, context, and emotional into instruction
>- expanding thinking about possible approaches (e.g. chaning, monitoring, passive search)

## Technical Services

- Overview of technical services: acquisitions, cataloging, and collections management
- Copy cataloguing vs. original cataloguing
- Classification
- Subject access
- Authority control and linked open data
- Metadata standards

------

## Acquisitions

- Moving to subscriptions and consortial access

- Varies greatly by library types
  - special libraries: going deep in a narrow area
  - academic libraries: monographs, serials / journals, faculty requests

------

## Acquisitions

- bibliographer recommendations
- trade publications
- working with intermediary vendors (Baker and Taylor, YBP, Blackwell)
    - library specifies material needs, and vendor automatically buys and ships materials

- Acquisitions Librarian - de-professionalizing (Helfer and Heinrich 2010)

-----

## Cataloguing

- describing materials for collection access, after acquisition

- Guidelines:
   - Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR) - 1967, AACR2 1988
   - Resource Description and Access (RDA)

------

- original cataloguing: creating a record from scratch
- copy cataloguing: starting with information from elsewhere

--------

# Vocabulary

From ODLIS (Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science):

-_bibliographic record_
An entry representing a specific item in a library catalog or bibliographic database, containing all the data elements necessary for a full description, presented in a specific bibliographic format.

-----

- Metadata: data about data (information about something)
- ODLIS: "Structured information describing information resources/objects for a variety of purposes."

--------

- three parts to cataloguing record: description, subject access and classification, and authority control

--------

## Subject access and classification

- subject analysis: what are the materials about?
  - uses a controlled vocabulary, like Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)

- classification: assigning a call number in a classification scheme, like Library of Congress (LCC), Dewey Decimal (DDC), or Universal Decimal System (UDC)

------

## Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)

<http://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&PAGE=First>

LCSH and LCC in context: [LOC online catalog](https://catalog.loc.gov/)

----------

## Authority control

- disambiguating strings from entities: connecting metadata to a central 'authority'

>- grouping authors with name variants, pseudonyms
>- Multiple versions of a work (translations, international version)
>- disentangling name matches
>- ISBN numbers, OCLC numbers

# Types of Libraries Discussion

- What is distinct about your type of library?
- Who does your library serve? What roles do librarians play?
- What types of libraries are similar?
- Can you think of examples of the library? How you been to one?
- How common is your library?
- Who funds the library type?
- What facts surprised you from the reading? What outstanding questions does the article not answer?

## Information Literacy instruction

- defining information literacy
- teaching information literacy
- active learning as a technique

-------

"Being able to effectively locate, evaluate, and apply information to meet a need is the foundation of lifelong learning" - Evans, p.71

------

>"Give a man some information, feed their information need for a session. Teach a man information literacy, feed their need for a lifetime (or, at least a few years)" - Old Librarian Proverb

-----

## Information literacy

to "be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information." - ALA 1989

_Transliteracy_: "ability to read, write, and interact across a range of platforms, tools, and media"

- increasingly thought of as a mix of literacies

------

![ACRL Information Literacy Resources](http://acrl.libguides.com/slilc/home)

------

The Seven Pillars of Information Literacy.

_What's missing? How do these skills develop?_

1. The ability to recognize a need for information.
2. The ability to distinguish ways in which the information “gap” may be addressed.
3. The ability to construct strategies for locating information.
4. The ability to locate and access information.
5. The ability to compare and evaluate information obtained from different sources.
6. The ability to organize, apply, and communicate information to others in appropriate ways.
7.The ability to synthesize and build upon existing information, contributing to the creation of new knowledge.

(http://www.sconul.ac.uk/groups/information_literacy/headline_skills.html updated February 2008).

-------

## Types of instruction

- formal instruction
    - e.g. tours and orientation; workshops on technology, searching skills, research skills
- informal
    - _remember that all interactions can be instructional!_ - it doesn't need to be designed as such

---------------------

### One-shot instruction: single session

_What are the downsides to one-shot instruction? What are the upsides?_

--------

- more realistic for scheduling
>- desire to cram as much information in <- less effective way of learning

-------

### course-integrated instruction

>- just-in-time librarianship
>- more effective learning
>- complicated logistics

-------

## Active Learning

Learning by participating in the process of learning - rather than sitting, listening, and memorizing

- "anything that involves students in doing things and thinking about the things they are doing" (Bonwell & Eison, 1991).

- "anything course-related that all students in a class session are called upon to do other than simply watching, listening and taking notes" (Felder & Brent (2009)

-------

### Benefits and Approaches

via [Cornell Center for Teaching Innovation](https://www.cte.cornell.edu/teaching-ideas/engaging-students/active-learning.html), [Stanford Teaching Commons](https://teachingcommons.stanford.edu/resources/teaching-resources/teaching-strategies), [Harvard Bok Center for Teaching and Learning](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/active-learning)

----------

### Approaches

>- think-pair-share: short partner discussions in class
>- problem- or case-based research projects
>- case studies
>- collaborative note taking
>- statement correction
>- quizzes and assessment
>- give time to think
>- preview and review
>- teaching material to a peer

-------

### Benefits

>- in lectures, attention starts to wane after 10-20 minutes
>- instructor is more sensitive to where students are, necessary corrections
>- addresses personal learning styles, allows for personal connections to materials

---------

## Planning Process

via Grassian and Kaplowitz (2009), ELIS

- recognize the need
- describe and analyze the situation
    - perform a needs assessment
- developing goals and learning outcomes
    - write from the learner's perspective
- develop materials
- deliver
- assess and revise
    - Do they like it? Do they get it? Can they do it? Does it matter?

# Assessment

Measuring service needs, impact and quality

- considers whether to _add_, _change_, or _drop_ programs

_Why assessment? How?_

---------

- aligns with goals: libraries _want_ to provide great services

- helps publicize a library's worth to its community, while considering how that value can be maximized

- Communication tool:  "Without data, it’s been said, 'you’re just another guy with an opinion.'" - [Outcome Based Evaluations](https://www.imls.gov/grants/outcome-based-evaluations), IMLS

- Value to _potential_ stakeholders; e.g. IMLS wants to see that their money would be put to good use, and Congress wants to see that IMLS makes an impact

--------

## Types of Assessment

- Needs assessment
- Impact assessment

Assessment has internal uses (determining if you have the correct services properly provided) and external uses (accountability to library stakeholders)

-----

## Impact assessment: instruction

- Satisfaction: did learners like the setting? The instructor?
    - Surveys
- Learning: was the content learned? Can the learner recontextualize it or recall it when needed?
- Behavior: can the learning be applied?

------

## Tools

- Surveys
- Interviews
- Focus groups
- observation
- Citation analysis
- Transaction log analysis
- Logs, Diaries, and journals

----

## Outcome-based Evaluation

- Drawing a line from _inputs_ to _outputs_, contextualized by goals, users, stakeholders

- _Outcomes_ tied to indicators, sources, and targets

- Example OBE worksheet: [Evaluation Framework, New York State Library](http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/libdev/obe/basic/evl_frm.pdf)

----

__OBE Evaluation Example 1: Columbia County Read Together Program__

Program Purpose: The Columbia County Public Library, Regional High School, Head Start, and Literacy Volunteers cooperate to provide story hours, literacy information, materials, and other resources to increase the time parents and other caretakers spend reading to children.

Intended Outcomes: Adults will read to children more often.

_Indicators:?
Sources: ?
Target: ?_

_via [IMLS](https://www.imls.gov/grants/outcome-based-evaluation/basics)_

------

Indicators: Number and percent of parents or other caretakers who read to children 5 times/week or more.

Data Source(s): Participant interviews.

Target for Change: At the end of year one, 75% of participating parents and other caretakers will read to children in their care 5 times per week or more.

------

__OBE Example 2: Museums Are Fun for Everybody__

Program Purpose: The Museum provides a series of workshops about its programs for mothers and 2- to 5-year-olds from the Hills High School parenting program and Cabot Park neighborhood to increase visits by local families and to increase the museum comfort level of mothers who rarely or never visit the museum.

Intended Outcomes: Mothers from Cabot Park and Hills High will feel more comfortable bringing kids to the museum and these families will use the museum more.

## Assessment in different library types

- Academic libraries
    - e.g. information literacy, learning support, technical skills
- Public libraries
    - e.g. basic literacy, consumer information, materials access, local history
- School libraries
    - e.g. problem-solving, digital skills, test prep
- Special libraries
    - return on investment, cost-benefit analysis

(Evans et. al 2015)

----------

## Summary

- what and why: assessment
- tools
- formative vs summative evaluation
- outcome-based evaluation

--------

## Needs assessment

- assessment between three interests:
    - community needs and culture, in the context of
    - the organization's mission and goals, tempered by
    - possibilities (space, time, budget, people)

# Reference

-----

__Reference Transactions__ are information consultations in which library staff recommend, interpret, evaluate, and/or use information resources to help others to meet particular information needs. Reference transactions do not include formal instruction or exchanges that provide assistance with locations, schedules, equipment, supplies, or policy statements.

- Reference and User Services Association (RUSA)

-----

A __reference transaction__ is an information contact that involves the knowledge, use, recommendations, interpretation, or instruction in the use of one or more information sources by a member of the library staff.

- Association of Research Libraries (ARL)

-----

__Reference Work__ includes reference transactions and other activities that involve the creation, management, and assessment of information or research resources, tools, and services.

- _Creation and management of information resources_ includes the development and maintenance of materials that patrons can use independently, in-house or remotely, to satisfy their information needs.
- _Assessment activities_ include the measurement and evaluation of reference work, resources, and services.

\- Reference and User Services Association (RUSA)

__What's notable here?__

--------

- 'information resources'
- 'Creation and management'
    - 'We need to adopt the concept of "reference authoring" in how we conceive of reference' - Lankes, Atlas of New Librarianship

------

## Types of Reference Services

- Reference
- Guidance
- Instruction

------------

## Reference

- Ready reference
- Bibliographical verification
- Interlibrary loan & Document delivery
- Information & Referral
- Research
- Fee-based & Information brokering

--------

## Guidance

- Readers Advisory (began in 1923 in Chicago)
- [Bibliotherapy](http://www.ala.org/tools/atoz/bibliotherapy) (began in 1951 at U. of IL)
- Term Paper Consulting
- SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information)

-------

## Instruction

- One-on-one
- Group

--------

Lankes: What's an 'answer'?

- librarians and users disagree
- users want something synthesized, librarians think in terms of sources

"We need to give members what they perceive as answers, not what we do"

----

Sometimes the answer is not enough

- appropriate response may require working with the user on learning how to get to the answer

--------

## Question Types

- __Directional__. Information about library services / space: "Where do I return my books?"
- __Instruction__. Learning to learn.
- __Ready Reference__. Simple factual questions: "What is the average weight of an Asian elephant?"
- __Reference__. More involved
- __Research__. Require several categories of tools, more comprehensive
- __Reader Advisory__. Connecting users to materials
- __Referral__. Connecting users to services

-------

## Reference interview

- Interaction designed to tease out the *real* questions
- Recalling our information behavior models: sometimes a user isn't sure what they don't know

------

Based on your own experiences, what do you think makes a good reference interview?

-----

>- Be approachable
>- ask user-based questions, not systems-based (Dervin)
>- ask open-ended questions (closed=yes/no, this/that), then focus
>- verify (paraphrasing and summarizing), ask follow-ups
>- avoid jargon
>- avoid negative closures

-------

## Negative closure

- abrupt ending
- disclaimer
- failure to reference
- ignoring clues for more help
- premature referral
- sends to google
- referring user elsewhere, far away
- convincing user to accept easier to find information
- warning against success
- unmonitored referral

(Conducting the Reference Interview, Nilsen and Radford)

------

Instead of asking a system
question... (Conducting the Reference Interview, Nilsen and Radford)

>- _System Question_: Have you looked in the catalog/ looked at the author field in the MARC record/ checked the shelves/checked the databases for your subject?
>- _User-centered question_: What have you done so far?

-------

>- Do you know the subject heading/ search terms? keywords?
>- What would you like the book/ article/ site to cover? / What would you like your map to show?

-------

>- Do you want a directory? / encyclopedia/ biographical dictionary?
>- How do you plan to use the information?

-------

>- Do you want books or articles?
>- What format would help you most?

-------

>- That particular book is out right now. Do you want us to put a hold on it?
>- Perhaps we have another book available that will cover the same topic. What specifically were you hoping that book would include?

- Overarching concerns
    - skew for 'this class is easy/hard'
- Some variety in user preferences
    - different classmates prefer/dislike class discussion/labs/in-class exercises/discussion boards
    - some people like Canvas, at least one person doesn't

# Outreach

-------

- What's outreach?
- Why?

-------

- focusing on services to infrequent users, nonusers, and traditionally underserved users

_For example?_

----

- poor, homeless, hungry
- immigrants, refugees, new Americans
- ethnically diverse people
- older adults
- adult new and non-readers
- incarcerated and ex-offenders
- people with disabilities
- LGBT populations
- rural and geographically isolated communities

- exclusive collections
- programs that don't address user experiences

------

- poor, homeless, hungry
- immigrants, refugees, new Americans
- ethnically diverse people
- people of color
- older adults
- adult new and non-readers
- incarcerated and ex-offenders
- people with disabilities
- LGBT populations
- rural and geographically isolated communities

## Bringing services to users

>- attending community events
>- classroom, camp, preschool visits
>- bookmobiles
>- little free libraries
>- Wheelie the Book Bike

## People of Color and LGBT populations

_Idea time! How might we serve systematically underrepresented or discriminated populations?_

-------

From ODLOS ([1](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/outreachtounderservedpopulations/servicespeople), [2]()):

- provide collections and programs that reflect their experience
- promote library services through relevant channels and events
- [recruit](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/workforcedevelopment/recruitmentfordiversity) staff where all people see themselves represented (relevant: [resources for librarians facing discrimination](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/workplace/discrimination))

-------

## Serving Non-English Speakers

>- [ODLOS - Top10 'To-Dos' ](http://www.ala.org/aboutala/offices/olos/toolkits/servetheworld) (_Good list for it's directness - it's doable!_)

-------

## Homeless and poor populations

What issues do the poor and homeless encounter?

>- card and access policies required fixed address
>- conflation between trouble patrons and homeless
>- ill-trained or uncomfortable staff
>- limited promotion at relevant community centers
>- limited library access, re: transportation or hours
>- lack of relevant programs

## Other groups

_What groups did you research for your bibliography? How can they be served?_

------

## Services for Blind and Physically-Handicapped Users

--------

###History

- late 19th c - Large libraries start collecting embossed books
    - expensive, unstandardized, local
- 1904 - Free Matter - mailing relevant materials for blind users is free
- 1917 - Revised Braille - US standard
- 1930s - Act to Provide Books for the Blind - establishing national library service
    - raised character books and audio books (talking books)

---------

- 1940s - appropriations to buy and distributed record players to loan to eligible readers
- 1960s - now formats - slowing records, using tape
    - tape also slowed down, so 'talking books' played 6hrs rather than 1.5hrs
- 1999 - Web-Braille: online access to Braille (for download and embossing; now knows as Braille and Audio Reading Download)
- 2000s - [ANSI/NISO Z39.86](http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/14650/Z39_86_2005r2012.pdf) - Standard for the Digital Talking Book

-------

### Copyright

- braille doesn't compete with publisher profits, but talking books might!

- _Solutions?_

------

>- copyright permission and statements
>- strict controls: LOC-produced talking books were centralized at libraries, with limited materials
>- DRM for digital talking books

-----

1996:

> It is not an infringement of copyright for an authorized entity to reproduce or to distribute copies or phonorecords of a previously published, nondramatic literary work if such copies or phonorecords are reproduced or distributed in specialized formats exclusively for use by blind or other persons with disabilities.

--------

## Materials for the Blind

- Braille: embossed dots
- Sight-saving Type: large-print (>13pt)
- Talking books
- descriptive video

- talking books: created by the government

---------

## Low-mobility, home-bound

>- building accessibility - elevator, automatic doors, braille signs, etc.
>- book delivery, book by mail
>- deposit collections
>- virtual reference

------

## Technology problems

What are the ways that we interface with technology in libraries?

------

>- mouse
>- keyboard
>- screen (high-density, low-density)
>- touchscreens
>- speakers
>- game controllers

--------------

>- switches, large mice, large trackballs, joybox
>- color correction
>- screen-reading software
>- voice-to-text
>- smart pens
>- captioning, descriptive text
>- eye-tracking

-------

![](images/keyboard.png)

-----

![](images/trackpad.jpg)

-----------

>- density scaling, magnification
>- stickykeys, filterkeys
>- extra large mouse pointers

-------

## Other web issues

- inaccessible text (e.g. in images)
- no alt text on images
- inaccessible or untested web design

-----

- complete a task using touch-to-text
- If you wear glasses, trying to use your phone or computer without them (at arm's length if near-sighted, close up if far-sighted). See if any accessibility settings make it easier to read the news.
- Try to watch a Youtube video muted, with automatic captioning. How effective are the captions? Try to find a movie scene where you're familiar with the dialogue.
- Put on mittens and try to read a magazine. Go to the table of contents, find an article that looks interesting, then flip to that page.
